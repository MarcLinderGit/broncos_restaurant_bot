# Denver Broncos Restaurant ChatBot

The Denver Broncos Restaurant ChatBot is a project that demonstrates various skills in building a retrieval-based chatbot system tailored for a restaurant serving delicious food. In this project, I employ techniques such as tf-idf scoring, word embedding models, and custom user-defined functions to create an interactive chatbot capable of answering a wide range of questions from restaurant diners.

## Project Overview

Retrieval-based chatbots are widely used in customer service environments, where user questions are typically constrained to a specific domain. In this case, my chatbot is designed to provide information about the restaurant's menu items while adding a touch of the Denver Broncos spirit (despite them going 1-4 on the season on Sunday ðŸ˜¢).

1. **Exit Commands Handling**: The chatbot allows users to gracefully end the conversation using predefined exit commands.

2. **User Interaction**: The chatbot engages users in a conversation, taking user input and responding to their queries.

3. **Intent Classification**: It classifies user intents by comparing their input to a set of predefined responses, selecting the most appropriate response.

4. **Entity Recognition**: The chatbot extracts candidate entities (menu items) from user messages to provide contextually relevant responses.

5. **Response Selection**: It selects responses based on both user intent and extracted entities, creating dynamic and context-aware replies.

6. **Code Modularity**: The project is organized into separate Python files, each with a specific purpose (e.g., responses, user functions), demonstrating code modularity and best practices.

## Project Structure

1. **restaurant_bot.py**: This is the main script that defines the chatbot's behavior, handles user input, and responds with information about the restaurant's menu items.

2. **user_functions.py**: Contains utility functions used by the chatbot to preprocess user input, compare word overlap, extract nouns, and compute word similarities.

3. **responses.py**: Stores a list of responses that the chatbot uses to answer user queries about menu items. Responses include placeholders for menu items that are filled based on user input.

## Running the ChatBot

To run the Denver Broncos Restaurant ChatBot:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

2. Install the required libraries (spacy, nltk) using `pip`:

   ```
   pip install spacy nltk
   ```

3. Download the spaCy English word vectors model:

   ```
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
   ```

4. Clone or download this project repository to your local machine.

5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `restaurant_bot.py`.

6. Run the chatbot script:

   ```
   python restaurant_bot.py
   ```

7. Start a conversation with the chatbot by entering questions or menu item preferences.
